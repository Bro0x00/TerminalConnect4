# TerminalConnect4

It's the classic game connect 4, but it runs in your terminal.
There is no AI opponent at this time, so you may actually have
to play against another person. In essence, there is no reason
for this project to exist except on the offchance that you're
training an AI connect four player.

BTW: Connect Four is a property of Hasbro. Please don't sue me :)
